# Next.js 15 Rendering Issue

This repository demonstrates a peculiar rendering issue encountered in a Next.js 15 application. The application fails to render the main page, displaying a blank screen or throwing an unexpected error.  The problem is not readily apparent in the code itself but likely stems from a misconfiguration or runtime environment incompatibility.

## Steps to Reproduce

1. Clone the repository.
2. Install dependencies: `npm install`
3. Run the development server: `npm run dev`

Observe the rendered page. It is expected to show a blank screen or an error related to page rendering rather than the expected 'Welcome to my Next.js app!' heading.

## Potential Causes and Solutions (Explore bugSolution.js for details)

The root cause of such issues can be subtle and depend on the project's setup. Some potential reasons include:

* **Incorrectly configured webpack:** Check webpack configurations (if custom ones are used) for conflicting rules or missing loaders. 
* **Server-side issues:**  Issues in server-side data fetching or API integration may inadvertently affect rendering.
* **Missing or conflicting dependencies:**  Ensure all necessary Next.js dependencies are correctly installed and compatible.
* **Runtime environment:**  There might be issues with the Node.js version, system libraries, or other environment-related settings. 
* **Missing or corrupted build artifacts:**  Try deleting the `.next` folder and restarting the server to rebuild the application.

This repository provides a minimal reproducible example to help diagnose and resolve this kind of unpredictable behavior in Next.js 15 apps.
